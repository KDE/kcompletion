/**
 * @class KCompletion kcompletion.h KCompletion
 *
 * @short A generic class for completing QStrings
 *
 * This class offers easy use of "auto completion", "manual completion" or
 * "shell completion" on QString objects. A common use is completing filenames
 * or URLs (see KUrlCompletion()).
 * But it is not limited to URL-completion -- everything should be completable!
 * The user should be able to complete email addresses, telephone numbers,
 * commands, SQL queries...
 * Every time your program knows what the user can type into an edit field, you
 * should offer completion. With KCompletion, this is very easy, and if you are
 * using a line edit widget (KLineEdit), it is even easier.
 * Basically, you tell a KCompletion object what strings should be completable
 * and, whenever completion should be invoked, you call makeCompletion().
 * KLineEdit and (an editable) KComboBox even do this automatically for you.
 *
 * KCompletion offers the completed string via the signal match() and
 * all matching strings (when the result is ambiguous) via the method
 * allMatches().
 *
 * Notice: auto completion, shell completion and manual completion work
 *         slightly differently:
 *
 * @li auto completion always returns a complete item as match.
 *     When more than one matching item is available, it will deliver just
 *     the first one (depending on sorting order). Iterating over all matches
 *     is possible via nextMatch() and previousMatch().
 *
 * @li popup completion works in the same way, the only difference being that
 *     the completed items are not put into the edit widget, but into a
 *     separate popup box.
 *
 * @li manual completion works the same way as auto completion, except that
 *     it is not invoked automatically while the user is typing,
 *     but only when the user presses a special key. The difference
 *     of manual and auto completion is therefore only visible in UI classes.
 *     KCompletion needs to know whether to deliver partial matches
 *     (shell completion) or whole matches (auto/manual completion), therefore
 *     KCompletion::CompletionMan and KCompletion::CompletionAuto have the exact
 *     same effect in KCompletion.
 *
 * @li shell completion works like "tab completion" in a shell:
 *     when multiple matches are available, the longest possible string of all
 *     matches is returned (i.e. only a partial item).
 *     Iterating over all matching items (complete, not partial) is possible
 *     via nextMatch() and previousMatch().
 *
 * As an application programmer, you do not normally have to worry about
 * the different completion modes; KCompletion handles
 * that for you, according to the setting setCompletionMode().
 * The default setting is globally configured by the user and read
 * from completionMode().
 *
 * A short example:
 * \code
 * KCompletion completion;
 * completion.setOrder(KCompletion::Sorted);
 * completion.addItem("pfeiffer@kde.org");
 * completion.addItem("coolo@kde.org");
 * completion.addItem("carpdjih@sp.zrz.tu-berlin.de");
 * completion.addItem("carp@cs.tu-berlin.de");
 *
 * cout << completion.makeCompletion("ca").latin1() << endl;
 * \endcode
 *
 * In shell-completion mode, this will be "carp"; in auto-completion
 * mode it will be "carp\@cs.tu-berlin.de", as that is alphabetically
 * smaller.
 * If setOrder was set to Insertion, "carpdjih\@sp.zrz.tu-berlin.de"
 * would be completed in auto-completion mode, as that was inserted before
 * "carp\@cs.tu-berlin.de".
 *
 * You can dynamically update the completable items by removing and adding them
 * whenever you want.
 * For advanced usage, you could even use multiple KCompletion objects. E.g.
 * imagine an editor like kwrite with multiple open files. You could store
 * items of each file in a different KCompletion object, so that you know (and
 * tell the user) where a completion comes from.
 *
 * Note: KCompletion does not work with strings that contain 0x0 characters
 *       (unicode null), as this is used internally as a delimiter.
 *
 * You may inherit from KCompletion and override makeCompletion() in
 * special cases (like reading directories or urls and then supplying the
 * contents to KCompletion, as KUrlCompletion does), but this is usually
 * not necessary.
