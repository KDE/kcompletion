/**
 * @class KLineEdit klineedit.h KLineEdit
 *
 * An enhanced QLineEdit widget for inputting text.
 *
 * \b Detail \n
 *
 * This widget inherits from QLineEdit and implements the following
 * additional functionalities: a completion object that provides both
 * automatic and manual text completion as well as multiple match iteration
 * features, configurable key-bindings to activate these features and a
 * popup-menu item that can be used to allow the user to set text completion
 * modes on the fly based on their preference.
 *
 * To support these new features KLineEdit also emits a few more
 * additional signals. These are: completion( const QString& ),
 * textRotation( KeyBindingType ), and returnPressed( const QString& ).
 * The completion signal can be connected to a slot that will assist the
 * user in filling out the remaining text. The text rotation signal is
 * intended to be used to iterate through the list of all possible matches
 * whenever there is more than one match for the entered text. The
 * @c returnPressed( const QString& ) signals are the same as QLineEdit's
 * except it provides the current text in the widget as its argument whenever
 * appropriate.
 *
 * This widget by default creates a completion object when you invoke
 * the completionObject( bool ) member function for the first time or
 * use setCompletionObject( KCompletion*, bool ) to assign your own
 * completion object. Additionally, to make this widget more functional,
 * KLineEdit will by default handle the text rotation and completion
 * events internally when a completion object is created through either one
 * of the methods mentioned above. If you do not need this functionality,
 * simply use KCompletionBase::setHandleSignals( bool ) or set the
 * boolean parameter in the above functions to false.
 *
 * The default key-bindings for completion and rotation is determined
 * from the global settings in KStandardShortcut. These values, however,
 * can be overridden locally by invoking KCompletionBase::setKeyBinding().
 * The values can easily be reverted back to the default setting, by simply
 * calling useGlobalSettings(). An alternate method would be to default
 * individual key-bindings by using setKeyBinding() with the default
 * second argument.
 *
 * If @c EchoMode for this widget is set to something other than @c QLineEdit::Normal,
 * the completion mode will always be defaulted to CompletionNone.
 * This is done purposefully to guard against protected entries such as passwords being
 * cached in KCompletion's list. Hence, if the @c EchoMode is not QLineEdit::Normal, the
 * completion mode is automatically disabled.
 *
 * A read-only KLineEdit will have the same background color as a
 * disabled KLineEdit, but its foreground color will be the one used
 * for the read-write mode. This differs from QLineEdit's implementation
 * and is done to give visual distinction between the three different modes:
 * disabled, read-only, and read-write.
 *
 * KLineEdit has also a password mode which depends of globals KDE settings. Use
 * KLineEdit::setPasswordMode instead of QLineEdit::echoMode property to have a password field.
 *
 * \b Usage \n
 *
 * To enable the basic completion feature:
 *
 * \code
 * KLineEdit *edit = new KLineEdit( this );
 * KCompletion *comp = edit->completionObject();
 * // Connect to the return pressed signal - optional
 * connect(edit,SIGNAL(returnPressed(const QString&)),comp,SLOT(addItem(const QString&)));
 * \endcode
 *
 * To use a customized completion objects or your
 * own completion object:
 *
 * \code
 * KLineEdit *edit = new KLineEdit( this );
 * KUrlCompletion *comp = new KUrlCompletion();
 * edit->setCompletionObject( comp );
 * // Connect to the return pressed signal - optional
 * connect(edit,SIGNAL(returnPressed(const QString&)),comp,SLOT(addItem(const QString&)));
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note if you specify your own completion object you have to either delete
 * it when you don't need it anymore, or you can tell KLineEdit to delete it
 * for you:
 * \code
 * edit->setAutoDeleteCompletionObject( true );
 * \endcode
 *
 * <b>Miscellaneous function calls :</b>\n
 *
 * \code
 * // Tell the widget to not handle completion and iteration automatically.
 * edit->setHandleSignals( false );
 *
 * // Set your own key-bindings for a text completion mode.
 * edit->setKeyBinding( KCompletionBase::TextCompletion, Qt::End );
 *
 * // Hide the context (popup) menu
 * edit->setContextMenuPolicy( Qt::NoContextMenu );
 *
 * // Default the key-bindings back to the default system settings.
 * edit->useGlobalKeyBindings();
 * \endcode
