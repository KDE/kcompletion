 * \class KLineEdit
 * \inmodule KCompletion
 *
 * \brief An enhanced QLineEdit widget for inputting text.
 *
 * This widget inherits from QLineEdit and implements the following
 * additional functionalities:
 * \list
 * \li a completion object that provides both automatic and manual text
 * completion as well as multiple match iteration features
 * \li configurable key-bindings to activate these features
 * \li a popup-menu item that can be used to allow the user to set text
 * completion modes on the fly based on their preference
 * \endlist
 *
 * To support these features KLineEdit also emits a few more additional
 * signals:
 * \list
 * \li completion(const QString &): this signal can be connected to
 * a slot that will assist the user in filling out the remaining text
 * \li textRotation(KeyBindingType): this signal is intended to be
 * used to iterate through the list of all possible matches whenever
 * there is more than one match for the entered text
 * \li returnKeyPressed(const QString &): this signal provides the
 * current text in the widget as its argument whenever appropriate (this
 * is in addition to the QLineEdit::returnPressed() signal which KLineEdit
 * inherits from QLineEdit).
 * \endlist
 *
 * This widget by default creates a completion object when you invoke
 * the completionObject(bool) member function for the first time or
 * use setCompletionObject(KCompletion *, bool) to assign your own
 * completion object. Additionally, to make this widget more functional,
 * KLineEdit will by default handle the text rotation and completion
 * events internally when a completion object is created through either one
 * of the methods mentioned above. If you do not need this functionality,
 * simply use KCompletionBase::setHandleSignals(bool) or set the boolean
 * parameter in the above functions to false.
 *
 * The default key-bindings for completion and rotation is determined
 * from the global settings in KStandardShortcut. These values, however,
 * can be overridden locally by invoking KCompletionBase::setKeyBinding().
 * The values can easily be reverted back to the default setting, by simply
 * calling useGlobalSettings(). An alternate method would be to default
 * individual key-bindings by using setKeyBinding() with the default
 * second argument.
 *
 * If EchoMode for this widget is set to something other than QLineEdit::Normal,
 * the completion mode will always be defaulted to CompletionNone.
 * This is done purposefully to guard against protected entries, such as
 * passwords, being cached in KCompletion's list. Hence, if the EchoMode
 * is not QLineEdit::Normal, the completion mode is automatically disabled.
 *
 * A read-only KLineEdit will have the same background color as a disabled
 * KLineEdit, but its foreground color will be the one used for the read-write
 * mode. This differs from QLineEdit's implementation and is done to give visual
 * distinction between the three different modes: disabled, read-only, and read-write.
 *
 * To enable the basic completion feature:
 *
 * \code
 * KLineEdit *edit = new KLineEdit(this);
 * KCompletion *comp = edit->completionObject();
 * // Connect to the Return pressed signal - optional
 * connect(edit, &KLineEdit::returnKeyPressed, comp, [this](const QString &text) { addItem(text); });
 * \endcode
 *
 * To use a customized completion object or your own completion object:
 *
 * \code
 * KLineEdit *edit = new KLineEdit(this);
 * KUrlCompletion *comp = new KUrlCompletion();
 * edit->setCompletionObject(comp);
 * // Connect to the return pressed signal - optional
 * connect(edit, &KLineEdit::returnKeyPressed, comp, [this](const QString &text) { addItem(text); });
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note if you specify your own completion object you have to either delete
 * it when you don't need it anymore, or you can tell KLineEdit to delete it
 * for you:
 * \code
 * edit->setAutoDeleteCompletionObject(true);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Miscellaneous function calls:
 *
 * \code
 * // Tell the widget to not handle completion and iteration automatically
 * edit->setHandleSignals(false);
 *
 * // Set your own key-bindings for a text completion mode
 * edit->setKeyBinding(KCompletionBase::TextCompletion, Qt::End);
 *
 * // Hide the context (popup) menu
 * edit->setContextMenuPolicy(Qt::NoContextMenu);
 *
 * // Default the key-bindings back to the default system settings
 * edit->useGlobalKeyBindings();
 * \endcode
