 * and more memory efficient than malloc. Additionally to a usual obstack
 * like allocator you can also free the objects individually. Because it
 * does no compaction it still is faster than malloc()/free(). Depending
 * on the exact usage pattern that might come at the expense of some
 * memory though.

     * Gives back a block returned by allocate() to the zone
     * allocator, and possibly deallocates the block holding it (when it's
     * empty). The first deallocate() after many allocate() calls
     * (or the first at all) builds an internal data structure for speeding
     * up deallocation. The consistency of that structure is maintained
     * from then on (by allocate() and deallocate()) unless many
     * more objects are allocated without any intervening deallocation, in
     * which case it's thrown away and rebuilt at the next deallocate().
     *
     * The effect of this is, that such initial deallocate() calls take
     * more time then the normal calls, and that after this list is built, i.e.
     * generally if deallocate() is used at all, also allocate() is a
     * little bit slower. This means, that if you want to squeeze out the last
     * bit performance you would want to use KZoneAllocator as an obstack, i.e.
     * just use the functions allocate() and free_since(). All the
     * remaining memory is returned to the system if the zone allocator
     * is destroyed.

     * \code
     * KZoneAllocator alloc(8192);
     * void *remember_me = alloc.allocate(0);
     * for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
     *   do_something_with (alloc.allocate(12));
     * alloc.free_since (remember_me);
     * \endcode
     * Note, that we don't need to remember all the pointers to the 12-byte
     * objects for freeing them. The free_since() does deallocate them
     * all at once.
     * \a ptr Pointer as returned by allocate(). It acts like
     * a kind of mark of a certain position in the stack of all objects,
     * off which you can throw away everything above that mark.
